[Intro] Dm  C  F  Am   Dm  C  F  G

C          Dm              F              G
I heard you on the wireless back in fifty two
C          Dm             F            G
Lying a-wake  in bed then  tuning in on  you
C        Dm              F               G
If I was  young it didn't  stop you coming  through
C            Dm        G
  Oh   -  ah   -    oh


C          Dm              F              G
They took the credit for your second symphony
C          Dm             F               G
Rewritten     by machine on and  new technology
C        Dm              F               G
And now I understand the problems you can see
C        Dm              F               G
(Oh-a-oh) I met your children
C        Dm              F               G
(Oh-a-oh) What did you tell them ?

C            F
Video killed the radio star
C            F
Video killed the radio star
C      G          F
Pictures came and broke your heart
G       Am
Oh-a-oh-oh-oh

C          Dm       F              G
And now we meet in an abandoned studio
C          Dm             F                G
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
C          Dm        F              G
And you remember the jingles used to go
C    Dm  F               G
(Oh-a-oh) You were the first one
C    Dm  F               G              G
(Oh-a-oh) You were the last one

C            F
Video killed the radio star
C            F
Video killed the radio star
C      G          F
In my    mind and   in my car,
C      G          F
we can't rewind we've gone to far

G           Am
Oh, a, a, a, oh
G           Am
Oh, a, a, a, oh

( Dm  G  C  F )
( Dm  G  C  F )
( Dm  G  Am  F )
( Dm  C  F  G )
( Am  F  Am  F  G )

C            F

C            F
Video killed the radio star
C      G          F
In my    mind and   in my car,
C      G          F
we can't rewind we've gone to far
C      G          F
Pictures came and broke your heart
C      G         F
Put the blame on VTR

   C  Dm       F    G
You are a radio star
   C  Dm       F    G
You are a radio star
C            F
